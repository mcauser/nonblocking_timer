Introduction
============

nonblockingtimer is a class to simplify the use of time.monotonic() when working with
CircuitPython. It keeps track of the time interval bookkeeping so you can simply
set a timer (or many), without using time.sleep(), and still respond to events
when your timer(s) is/are sleeping.

Dependencies
=============
This driver depends on:

* `Adafruit CircuitPython <https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython>`_

Please ensure all dependencies are available on the CircuitPython filesystem.
This is easily achieved by downloading
`the Adafruit library and driver bundle <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle>`_.

Usage Example
=============

.. code:: python

  class BlinkDemo(NonBlockingTimer):
      def __init__(self):
          super(BlinkDemo, self).__init__(0.1)
          self.led = digitalio.DigitalInOut(board.D13)
          self.led.direction = digitalio.Direction.OUTPUT
          self.value = True

      def stop(self):
          self.led.value = False

      def next(self):
          if (super(BlinkDemo, self).next()):
              self.led.value = not (self.led.value)

  blinkdemo.BlinkDemo()

  while True:
    blinkDemo.next()
    # This is the only place you should use time.sleep: to set the overall
    # "sampling rate" of your program.
    time.sleep(0.001)
